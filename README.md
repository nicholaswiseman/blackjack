# blackjack


About:

This is the second milestone project for the Udemy course Complete Python Bootcamp: Go From Zero to Hero... by Jose Portilla. 

It is a simple blackjack game meant to be played in the command window.

Game Flow:
 
The player starts with 100 credits.
The first action by the player is to place their bet. (not greater than your current # of credits)
The player will then be dealt two cards. If the player does not get blackjack they will be asked to hit or pass.
If the player hits they will be dealt another card and if they did not get 21 or bust they will be asked again.
This will repeat until the player passes, gets 21 or busts.
The dealer will then be dealt two cards.
As long as the dealer has less than the player the dealer will hit. 
If the dealer has the same total as the player the dealer will hit under 12 and take a push if 12 or over.
The hand ends when the dealer busts, beats the player, or pushes.
If the player wins their wager is added to their total credits. If a loss, subtracted. If a push no change.
As long as the player has over 0 credits they will be asked to play again.
